# Fashion Recycled  

## Problem Statement  
**“Huge amounts of fashion waste produced by manufacturing firms and designers isn’t recycled or repurposed.”**  

### Key Insights  
- Fashion waste accounts for at least **7% of global waste**.
- Less than **1% of fashion waste is recycled** ([Source: WEF](https://www.weforum.org)).
- Fast fashion leads to environmental degradation, increased emissions, and loss of resources.

## Motivation  
Fashion waste is a growing environmental crisis with significant global impact. Key facts highlighting the urgency:  
1. **92 million tonnes** of textile waste is produced annually.  
2. The apparel industry’s emissions will rise by **50% by 2030**.  
3. **20% of global wastewater** is from the fashion industry.  
4. Microplastics from textiles contribute **10% of ocean pollution**.  
5. **$500 billion** is lost annually due to under-wearing and failure to recycle.  

We aim to address these challenges by **connecting fashion manufacturers and recyclers** to ensure proper disposal and repurposing of fashion waste.
